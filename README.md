PlasmaCraft
===========

PlasmaCraft is a Minecraft mod that has been around for several years now.  It has been dead for almost a year, but I've decided to once more try to revive it.  I'm hopeful that the Forge system has improved enough to remove some of the issues I was having that made me want to drop it in the first place.

Setup
===========

My first step in the revival process is going to be to set up the dev environment with ForgeGradle, hopefully with the help of Abrar to get it set up like ForgeEssentials.
Once that is done, it will then be a huge mass of block and item updates, and I have no idea where that's going to start.

Information
===========

Hopefully, once this is back up and running, I will be able to set up a website on my new domain www.malkierian.com with all the information anyone will need to download, install, and use the mod.
